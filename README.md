## What is it? What does it do?
Here is a short summary: Basically it is just a fun project to create mesmerizing patterns and animations.  
Does it really serve a purpose? Not really. But sometimes fun is purpose enough! Additionally working on fun projects is the best way to learn. And maybe along the way we will find ways to visualize abstract concepts and other actually useful things.

Now a more detailed explanation: The concept is that an empty window is created which will be filled with awesome patterns. This process takes some time and this is the fun part. It is really mesmerizing to watch what you have previously planned out slowly take shape. The project offers lots of different ways to express your ideas and we hope that your imagination will be the limiting factor to what you can create :)

We hope the concept is pretty self explanytory. Enough talk for now! Let's get you started!
