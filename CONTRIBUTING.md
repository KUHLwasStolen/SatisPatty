## Contributing
First of all thank you for considering to contribute.  
Here you will learn what is contributable and how you can do it.

### Contributing by issues  
The first and also most simple way to contribute is through creating issues.  
This can be done [here.](https://github.com/KUHLwasStolen/SatisPatty/issues)  
But before you do anything please go through some existing issues and check if your issue might already exist. If a similar issue exists you can also comment on that and add your concern. This helps reduce the time it takes to read through every single issue and sort out duplicates.  
If the above is not the case you can click "new issue".  
Then you will be prompted with different templates for your issue to choose from.  
The following table will help you decide which one to use.

| Template name | Use-cases | Not for this |
|---|---|---|
| Bug/error report | Bugs, major problems (wrong formulations, misinformation, missing documentation, etc.), anything that makes the project very hard to use | Typos, feature request, hard to understand formulations, etc. |
| Minor error report | Typos, better formulations, better formatations, anything that is at max annoying, etc. | Bugs, anything that makes the project unusable |
| Feature request | New ideas, missing functionality, simplification of processes, big quality of life improvements, etc. | Everything covered by the other templates |

### Contribute your own code  
If you have worked on something in your own fork of the project and want to share it with everyone you can create a pull request for your repo ([here](https://github.com/KUHLwasStolen/SatisPatty/pulls)).  

If you have added a new file use following template at the very top of it:  
~~~
/*  
 * Description: A short and simple description of the purpose/use of this file  
 * Creator: @[your GitHub tag]  
 * Editor(s): @[your tag]; @[other people who have worked on this]; ...  
 * Version: V[version of the file (probably V1.0)]  
 * License: GPLv3  
*/ 
~~~ 

Also please pay good attention to proper documentation (e.g. comments in your code) of your code so people can understand it. This also includes simple and obvious variable names. Use camelCase for variables and ALL_CAPS for constants. You CAN use Hungarian notation for variables, but this is up to you.

Additionally your code should of course work with few to none bugs.  
To increase your chance of your code being pulled to trunk (default branch) your code should solve a current issue or bring a totally new feature with it.  
Furthermore it would be good if you have some kind of way to contact you in your GitHub profile.  

<br></br>
For the case that you have just edited an existing file please do the following.
Update the comment in the first line to something like this:
~~~
/*  
 * Description: (only change this if necessary)  
 * Creator: @[creator]  
 * Editor(s): @[creator]; @...; @[your GitHub tag]  
 * Version: (if you fixed a bug change the version for example from this V1.2.0 to V1.2.1 and if you added a feature like this from V1.2.1 to V1.3.0)  
 * License: GPLv3  
*/  
~~~

The other "rules" also apply here (documentation etc).
